          <h4>Workshop : WORKSHOP ON INDUSTRY 4.0 AND DIGITAL TWIN</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>Industry 4.0 represents the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of smart technologies into every facet of industrial processes.At the core of Industry 4.0 is the Digital Twin concept. A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system. It goes beyond a mere 3D model; it mirrors the physical object's behavior and performance in real-time. For a manufacturing workshop, this means having a virtual counterpart that replicates every nuance of the production process.</p>

          <h4>DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSTRIP PATCH ANTENNA WITH NANOFERRITE MATERIAL</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>	In this paper, a rectangular microstrip patch antenna is designed using HFSS software. The designed antenna has a resonating frequency of 2.4 GHz which is applicable to Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). This paper shows the design considerations of the proposed antenna as well as the simulated results of the same. The design is made on Dysprosium copper ferrite material used as a dielectric material with its dielectric constant = 4.4 and thickness of 1.6mm.
            The substrate and patches are created.The designed antenna is suitable for 
            mobile communication,cell communication antennas etc...The simulation gave 
            requirements to fabricate it on hardware which can be used wherever needed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>	Agriculture is the major source of income for the largest population in India and
            is major contributor to Indian economy. However, technological involvement and its
            usability have to be grown still and cultivated for agro sector in India. Although few
            initiatives have also been taken by the Indian Government for providing online and mobile
            messaging services to farmers related to agricultural queries and agro vendorâ€™s information 
            to farmers. Based on the survey it is observed that agriculture contributes 27% to GDP, and
            Provides employment to 70% of Indian population.A Bluetooth controlled data logger robot for soil testing would be a robot 
            equipped with sensors to measure various soil properties such as 
            moisture,temperature and PH.</p>

          <h5>AN EFFICIENT MONITORING SYSTEM WITH COST ARCHITECTURE FOR MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>
            In modern manufacturing industries, ensuring the safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness of operations is paramount. One critical aspect is monitoring
            environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity levels, as well as
            detecting issues like leaks promptly. Traditional Distributed Control Systems (DCS)
            have been the standard for such monitoring, but their high cost can be a significant
            barrier for smaller or budget-conscious industrial setups. This project introduces a
            cost-effective and efficient alternative solution to address this challenge by utilizing
            the DHT11 sensor, Arduino microcontroller, and XAMPP for data management.
            This system aims to provide real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities, enabling
            industries to respond swiftly to environmental anomalies while minimizing costs.
